# ATLAS-Automated-Web-Debugger
This automated web crawler script is built in python. It will crawl the website using the start page/base domain provided and automatically check for the supported list of tags (below) rendering them in chromium (headless browser). The marketing tags network requests are intercepted and extracted to be written in separate CSV files for each vendor as the output file format.
